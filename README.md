ABSTRACT
Background Studies evaluating peripheral patient
samples show radiation can modulate immune responses,
yet the biological changes in human tumors particularly
at the cellular level remain largely unknown. Here, we
address how radiation treatment shapes the immune
compartment and interactions with cancer cells within
patient with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors.
